Here's a sentence of paragraph text.

## Headers, Bold, Italic
The above header is a large one. It's preceded by two pound signs. Large titles should be used sparingly, usually for a super-header that will have a number of categories with small headers.

### This is a small title
Use small titles for new sections.

*Bold text is created by using an asterisk before and after it.*
**Italics are added by using two asterisks before and after it.**

### Code

Want an inline code-snippet? Put `angled single quotes` around some text.

Want a block of code?

```Swift
Put three slanted quotes and then the name of the language you're coding in on one line (with no space in between).
Then write some code. Highlighting will be applied automatically.
To end it, use three slanted single quotes.
```

### Images
Images must be included in the same directory, and then can be linked like this: ``![Photoshop_reseting-workspace.png](Photoshop_reseting-workspace.png)``

### Codepen
To embed a Codepen, insert: ``<codepen source="BcHqe"></codepen>`` where the source attribute is equal to the string at the end of the URL after you save.

### Videos
Videos should be uploaded to our vimeo account (email it to your course developer to do so), and embedded with the following: ``<aframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/109154075"></aframe>``. 

### Metadata
Here's an example of metadata. Every content.md file must be preceded by metadata that has opening and closing dashes, liss the time, type, name, and author:

The type should either be `project` if you'd like the assignment to have a submission form at the end (which sends the assignment to the student's mentor) or `written content` (if there's no submission). The `name` field is for the title of the assignment, and will appear at the top of the assignment and in the navigation. Try to use actionable names like "Build Flabby Bird" or "Master CSS Animations". Use the author field to give yourself some credit. We don't currently display the author, but may in the future. If you make a substantial revision, add yourself as a second author.
